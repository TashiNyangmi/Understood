1st Hypothesis
**ASSUMPTION** : 12 years of educational attainment signifies HS degree

The two populations refer to the sub-group with and without a High School degree (at least).

1.   Null hypothesis: The proportions of wives working for the two populations are equal.

2.   Alternative hypothesis: The proportions of wives working for the two populations are different. (More specifically, the proportions of wives working is greater for those without HS degree)

Notations

1.  HS_yes_w = with High school degree, and 
2.   HS_no_w = without High school degree

Hypothesis
1.   Null         :  HS_yes_w = HS_no_w 
2.   Alternative  :  HS_no_w - HS_yes_w >0
